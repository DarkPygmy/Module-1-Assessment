// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

/*
Planning
Analysis of Requirements
Design
Implementation
Testing and Integration
Maintain
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements =  "A deeper dive is continued once a client or developers has chosen a solution. Any existing documentation is looked at alongwith existing ecosystems."
const design = "During this phase, the developerse then create multiple product architectures and shows them to the client or each other, once complete analysis of requirements of earlier cycle stages is completed."
const implementation = "One of the most crucial phases, we now aim to produce functioning code and show the fruits of our labor to the client or other developers. This usually takes up most time in any project. As happens, the project might end up exceding the estimate time. Sometimes it's the result of added scope to the project over the implementation process. Occasionaly the programs parameters and goals change to meet different demands."
const testingAndIntegration = "Automation and manual testing are used to check for any bugs. QA analysis included testing for any errors and seeing if it meets developer or customer requirments. As teams test the the code they are writing, it occurs concurrently to the implementation phase. Integrated are any other features that are required as a result of any errors, bugs or new features that are deemed neccessary for this software."
const maintain = "Resolving user issues and software changes becomes a neccessity in this phase. The team alos monitors overall system performance, security alongside user expiernce to identify better ways of improving the software."
